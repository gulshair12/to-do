 What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of web development and improve my skills. Here are some key lessons I learned:

    Styling with Tailwind CSS: I gained proficiency in using Tailwind CSS to create a sleek and modern user interface. The utility-first approach of Tailwind made styling efficient and allowed me to maintain a consistent design.

    React Components and Props: I learned how to create modular components and pass data between them using props. This made the code more organized and easier to maintain.

    Routing: I implemented routing in the project, enabling smooth navigation between different sections of the website. This was crucial for providing an excellent user experience.

    State Management with useState Hook: I utilized the useState hook to manage the state of the application. This allowed for dynamic updates and interactions without the need for complex state management libraries.

    Mapping Arrays of Objects: I used JavaScript's map function to render lists of tasks dynamically, making the code more scalable and flexible.
